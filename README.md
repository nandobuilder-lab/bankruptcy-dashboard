# Project Description

This repo implements the US Bankruptcy dashboard I vibe-coded with Claude Code. I worked with Claude Code to data engineer bankruptcy data from US Courts as there is no public data series available today in tools such as FRED. It covers information from the early 2000s about US bankruptcy in a dashboard form and a presentation (links eblow). As part of this process, I vibe coded a scraper to consistently extract data from US courts, a ETL pipepline to maintain a database, and an integration with FRED to compare with other macro economic series. For now, this repo holds only the final database and dashboard piece, but I will upload the other pieces later.

## Evidence Template Project

## Using Codespaces

If you are using this template in Codespaces, click the `Start Evidence` button in the bottom status bar. This will install dependencies and open a preview of your project in your browser - you should get a popup prompting you to open in browser.

Or you can use the following commands to get started:

```bash
npm install
npm run sources
npm run dev -- --host 0.0.0.0
```

See [the CLI docs](https://docs.evidence.dev/cli/) for more command information.

**Note:** Codespaces is much faster on the Desktop app. After the Codespace has booted, select the hamburger menu → Open in VS Code Desktop.

## Get Started from VS Code

The easiest way to get started is using the [VS Code Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Evidence.evidence-vscode):



1. Install the extension from the VS Code Marketplace
2. Open the Command Palette (Ctrl/Cmd + Shift + P) and enter `Evidence: New Evidence Project`
3. Click `Start Evidence` in the bottom status bar

## Get Started using the CLI

```bash
npx degit evidence-dev/template my-project
cd my-project 
npm install 
npm run sources
npm run dev 
```

Check out the docs for [alternative install methods](https://docs.evidence.dev/getting-started/install-evidence) including Docker, Github Codespaces, and alongside dbt.
